# PhotoSnap Website
Fully responsive and dynamic marketing site for a photo-sharing app that utilises complex and engaging CSS for a unique content flow. Project from www.frontendmentor.io which provided the design specifications and basic graphics to showcase the desired final product. All the images and icons were provided alongside the design as part of their premium subscription. The main aim of the project was to showcase high-level CSS and ability to convert complex designs into a functional and interactive final product. 

## Potential Improvements
The project went quite well as the efficiency of the production was high throughout, although several improvements that could have been made. One such improvement would have been a more strategic approach to how the initial groundwork was built; as much of the website followed a similar layout I could have allowed cut down on CSS required by better acknowledging this similarities and creating more universal classes to allow easy sharing of styling properties. React also would have been a great framework to utilise in this project especially for the creation of stories and to allow higher maintenance and possible expansion of the project. This though was a purposeful decision as the primary focus of the project was CSS and HTML, hence introducing React into the project would dilute attention and resources from that core focus. Overall, the project did smoothly as I was able to handle the complex responsiveness needed for the project through display grid and more modern features of CSS such as clamp to handle content resizing more dynamically.   

## Final Notes
Some alterations were made in the final product for this site that does not align with the design spec that should be acknowledged. Many of such changes include the introduction of make accessible font sizing and animations to make the site more usable. Alongside this some responsive behaviour also was altered in order to ensure greater utilisation of space to create more readability. Certain stylistic choices were affecting the website's ability to be easy to digest and manoeuvre. Due to this, adjustments were made for the benefit of the final work.
